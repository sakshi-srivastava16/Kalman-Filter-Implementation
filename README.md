# ðŸ“Š Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting using Kalman Filter & Linear Regression

This project implements **Kalman Filtering** and **Linear Regression** techniques to forecast cryptocurrency prices (BTC & ETH).  
It explores the use of **probabilistic state estimation** (Kalman Filter) and **supervised regression** for short-term price prediction, model evaluation, and performance comparison.

##  Features

-  **Kalman Filter Smoothing:** Applies the Kalman Filter to denoise BTC and ETH price signals.  
- **Forecasting:** Predicts future price trends for different horizons (10, 50, 100, 200 days).  
- **Linear Regression Model:** Trains a regression model using scaled price features.  
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates forecasts with RÂ², MAPE, RMSE, and MAE.  
-  **Modular Code:** Easily adaptable for other time series (e.g., stocks, forex).
